		<P align=center>The founder of the Yoshimi project:<BR>
			Alan Ernest Calvert (1950 - 2011)</P>

		<P>Cal Lived in Australia and married his childhood sweetheart, but sadly she died
		when their only child was still a toddler. He brought her up single-handed -
		never remarried, and according to his daughter, never even looked at another
		woman.</P>

		<P>When he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer nobody thought he'd survive long
		enough to see his first grandson born. To everyone's astonishment, he actually
		fought it off for FIVE years, so not only saw, but got to know both of the
		boys.</P>

		<P>Through all this, he never lost his sense of humour. This is evident in the
		old README file (preserved in /doc/History) and some of his Yoshimi list
		entries. For a long time on his website, there was a picture of his daughter and
		the boys, simply titled: "Three reasons to be cheerful".</P>

		<P>Survival rate for this cancer is very low - life expectancy usually less than 6
		months. However, it wasn't this that killed him, but in his weakened
		state he developed another type of cancer.</P>

		<P>Those who knew Cal miss him greatly.  One of his legacies is a whole lot of
		our wonderful software synthesizer, which he called Yoshimi.</P>

		<P>His original home page can be viewed <A HREF=original.html>here.</A></P>

          <div class="heading">On the name Yoshimi...</div>
          <p>
          The music of The Flaming Lips long held a special place in the
          lives of Cal and his family. As Yoshimi (the synth) evolved and
          needed a name, the lyrics of The Flaming Lips' song 
          <a href="http://www.flaminglips.com/history/discography/yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/" target="_blank">
          Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> came strongly to mind. Yoshimi
          it was to be.
