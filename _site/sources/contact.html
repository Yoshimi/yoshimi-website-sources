<h1>Get in touch!</h1>
<p>
  Here are the avenues of communication if you want to help out or have questions or suggestions related to the project.
</p>

<h2 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h2>

<p>
  Most communication and announcements happen via the mailing list -
  an age-old means of communication that is both asynchronous and reliable.
  You can find more information about it, and sign up to it
  <a href="https://www.freelists.org/list/yoshimi" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Project pages</h2>

<p>
  Yoshimi's primary project page is on
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/yoshimi/">SourceForge</a> where
  you can find downloads, get news, post reviews and create bug tickets.
</p>

<p>
  If SourceForge is down, you can find a mirror of the code available on
  <a href="https://www.github.com/yoshimi/yoshimi/">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>
  If you find a bug in Yoshimi, please inform us by creating a bug report.
</p>
<p>
  With a SourceForge account, the best (and preferred) way is to create new ticket
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/yoshimi/bugs/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If instead you have a GitHub account and don't want to create a SourceForge account,
  you can report your bug in a new <a href="https://www.github.com/yoshimi/yoshimi/issues">issue</a>
  on GitHub instead.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes a bug in an older version of Yoshimi may already be
  fixed by the time you discover it. If you are able, please check
  if the bug is still present in the latest build before reporting it.
